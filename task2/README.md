# üîê Key Management System (KMS)

## Overview
The **Key Management System (KMS)** is a secure encryption framework that enables **symmetric and asymmetric encryption**, as well as **Diffie-Hellman key exchange** for secure communications. It ensures secure key generation, storage, distribution, and revocation.

## Features
‚úÖ **AES-256 Symmetric Encryption** (for secure data transmission)  
‚úÖ **RSA Asymmetric Encryption** (for public-private key cryptography)  
‚úÖ **Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)** (for lightweight security)  
‚úÖ **Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange (ECDH)** (for secure key agreement)  
‚úÖ **Secure Key Storage** (AES keys, RSA/ECC key pairs)  
‚úÖ **Key Rotation and Revocation**

##  Secure Key Exchange Using Diffie-Hellman
The system implements the **Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange** to establish a shared secret over an insecure channel. This ensures that:  
- The secret key is never transmitted directly.  
- Even if an attacker intercepts the exchange, the key remains protected.  
- An authenticated Diffie-Hellman variation (e.g., with digital signatures) can be used to prevent MITM attacks.  

## Key Revocation in Case of Compromise
- **Symmetric Keys:** The KDC periodically updates session keys and revokes compromised keys.  
- **Asymmetric Keys:** The CA updates the **CRL** and issues **Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) responses** to notify entities of revoked certificates.  
- **Compromised Entities:** If a private key is compromised, affected users must regenerate key pairs and request a new certificate.  

## Security Mitigations Against Attacks  

### ** Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks**  
- PKI ensures that public keys are verified and signed by a trusted CA.  
- Diffie-Hellman can be enhanced with authentication to prevent unauthorized interception.  
- Secure TLS/SSL channels are used to encrypt key exchanges.  

### Key Compromise Protection
- Keys are stored in secure, encrypted environments with limited access.  
- Key rotation policies are enforced to replace old keys at regular intervals.  
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA) and access control policies protect administrative access to the key management system.  

## Conclusion
The designed key management system provides a robust framework for handling encryption keys securely. By integrating centralized key distribution for symmetric encryption and PKI for asymmetric encryption, the system ensures confidentiality, integrity, and authentication in communication. Additionally, mechanisms like **Diffie-Hellman key exchange, key revocation, and access control** enhance security against various threats, including MITM attacks and key compromises.

## üìå Installation
### Prerequisites

  ```bash
  pip install cryptography pycryptodome
  ```

## üîë How It Works

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Symmetric Key Encryption (AES-256)**
- AES keys are **generated and securely stored**.
- Data is **encrypted and decrypted** using **AES-256 in CBC mode**.
- Example:
  ```python
  kms = KeyManagementSystem()
  key_id = "session1"
  kms.generate_symmetric_key(key_id)
  encrypted = kms.encrypt_data_symmetric(key_id, "Hello World")
  decrypted = kms.decrypt_data_symmetric(key_id, encrypted)
  print("Decrypted:", decrypted)  # Output: "Hello World"
  ```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Asymmetric Key Encryption (RSA)**
- **RSA keys** (2048-bit) are generated.
- **Public keys encrypt** data, **private keys decrypt** data.
- Example:
  ```python
  key_id = "user1"
  kms.generate_asymmetric_key_pair(key_id)
  encrypted = kms.encrypt_asymmetric(key_id, "Hello Asymmetric")
  decrypted = kms.decrypt_asymmetric(key_id, encrypted)
  print("Decrypted:", decrypted)  # Output: "Hello Asymmetric"
  ```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange (ECDH)**
- Two parties generate **Elliptic Curve (ECC) key pairs**.
- They exchange **public keys** to derive a **shared secret**.
- Example:
  ```python
  private_A, public_A = kms.generate_diffie_hellman_keys()
  private_B, public_B = kms.generate_diffie_hellman_keys()
  shared_secret_A = kms.derive_shared_secret(private_A, public_B)
  shared_secret_B = kms.derive_shared_secret(private_B, public_A)
  print(shared_secret_A == shared_secret_B)  # True
  ```

## üîê Security Considerations
- **Keys should be stored securely in HSMs or encrypted vaults.**
- **Use TLS/SSL for key transmission to prevent MITM attacks.**
- **Regular key rotation and revocation improve security.**
- **Public keys should be verified using a trusted CA in real-world applications.**
- **Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) should be considered for future security threats.**

---

## üìù To-Do (Future Enhancements)
- ‚úÖ Add **digital signatures** for authentication.
- ‚úÖ Implement a **Certificate Authority (CA)** for signing/verifying public keys.
- ‚úÖ Store keys securely in a **database or HSM** instead of in-memory.
- ‚úÖ Add **user authentication (MFA, role-based access control)** for better security.
