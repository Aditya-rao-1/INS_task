# INS_task
This project analyzes three classical encryption techniques: the Playfair, Hill, and Vigen√®re Ciphers. It examines their encryption methods, complexities, strengths, weaknesses, and cryptanalysis approaches. The discussion includes their vulnerabilities and proposes a hybrid cipher design to address these limitations.
